                    <br>
                    Charlie tells him that he has to write down his goals, this will force Michael to think of what he wants to achieve then manifest it into writing, which would immediately spark the thoughts into Michael's head, of how he is going to achieve theses goals.
                    <br>
                    It was also conveyed to Michael that if you set a goal to set save a set amount in 0 years, think about ho you can save a fraction of it in a 5 years anda fraction of that amount in 2 years.

                    In Chapter 5 Michael meets Charlie again and tells him he had written down his life goals and has no idea where to start. Charlie tells him that it's better to take the risk and try than to life with regret. He tells Michael he needs to take charge of his life now, and that he himself is quite happy with how his life turned out.
                    <br>
                    He told Michael that if that the opportunities that arise align with any of his life goals, he is heading in the right direction.

                <h4>
                    Chapter 6, gets more intense and harder for Michael to handle. Charlie teaches Michael that in order to be successful, you need to have the correct mindset but also surround yourself with those who share similar views of success. 
                    <br>
                    Charlie told him that he should analyze who he has around him, his friends in particular and if they are holding him back and demotivating him psychologically. 
                    <br>
                    Michael did not want to accept that his friends indeed were not benefitting his aspirations.
                    <br>
                    Michael advises him that if he realizes that the friendship is not his career's best interest he should reconsider being friends with them, which Michael was reluctant to accept until he came to a realization that that was indeed the case.

                <h4>
                    The final lesson to Charlie was the importance of learning, learning not only at school or in an institution but daily learning. 
                    <br>
                    Learning from others, those from who are wealthy, those who are experienced, just learning from people. 
                    <br>
                    Charlie also stressed the importance of reading books , which Michael was not fond of. Michael thinking books are a scam and a get rich scheme, but Charlie ensured the best way to get knowledge is from books.
                    <br>
                    Reading about other peoples experiences and what they have discovered and imparting this knowledge in his life. 
                    <br>
                    Michael was recommended some books to read and was even given one to read, which he expressed his utmost gratitude for as well as for all that charlie taught him.
